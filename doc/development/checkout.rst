Checking out the Code
=====================

- ``git://github.com/IgnitedAndExploded/pyfire.git`` â€” the primary repository

Clone the branch using git
--------------------------

Open up a Terminal of your choice, then just run::

    $ git clone git://github.com/IgnitedAndExploded/pyfire.git

You'll get the master branch initially, may want to switch to another one or create your own

Clone the branch using TortoiseGit
----------------------------------

If you don't have `TortoiseGit`_ installed yet, grab a copy on their site for both TortoiseGit **and** msysgit. Install them and reboot your box afterwards.

To clone the branch using TortoiseGit on Windows, right click on a empty place in Explorer and choose to clone from the URL given above. No more magic needed. We assume it to live in *C:\\pyfire* later on, so you might want to use that
